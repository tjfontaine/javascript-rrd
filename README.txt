javascriptRRD
=============
javascriptRRD package contains a set of Javascript libraries
that can be used for reading RRD archives from any Web browser.
Mozilla, Internet Explorer and Safari havae been tested.

Javascript being an interpreted language, requires no compilation.
Just copy the files located at

  src/lib

and place them into a web accessible location and use them.

The directory 

  src/examples/

contains example web pages that you can use as a template
for writing your own web app for accessing the RRD archives on your 
web server.

While the code itself tries to be self documenting, the 

  doc/lib/

directory contains more detailed information about the libraries.
